# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

#  Functionality
This Work day scheduler was made from javascript, css, and html. This application allows a user to write a list of what needs to be done. The time slots are color coded to help the user know what needs to be done. There are three different colors. First is the red color for the current time. The grey timeslot means the hour has past. The green means the timeslow is still availble and is upcoming. Any text added into the boxes will be saved even after refreshing the webpage. The webpage will reset the next day.
